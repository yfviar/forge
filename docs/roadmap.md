### Desktop App
- [x] Auto-update via electron-updater + GitHub Releases
- [ ] Code signing + notarization — **blocked: requires Apple Developer $99/yr**
- [ ] Homebrew Cask (`brew install --cask forge`) — **blocked: requires code signing + notarization first**

### Documentation

## Future

### Dashboard
- [ ] Dashboard auth (optional password protection)
- [ ] Session recording / replay (asciinema-style)
- [ ] Notification sounds on session exit / pattern match
- [ ] One-shot prompt form in dashboard UI
- [ ] Custom user templates via `~/.forge/templates.json`

### Agents
- [x] Gemini CLI support (spawn, chat browser, stream parser — same integration as Codex)

### Platform
- [ ] Windows ConPTY support
- [ ] Docker support
- [ ] Remote sessions / SSH
- [ ] Multiple MCP clients sharing one Forge server

### Protocol
- [ ] MCP Tasks primitive (long-running tool IDs — spec still evolving)
- [ ] A2A protocol support (agent-to-agent discovery — waiting for client adoption)

> Size estimates: S (~1 day), M (~2-3 days), L (~1 week), XL (~2+ weeks)
> Dashboard streaming is the highest-impact UX improvement from benchmarking.
> Cross-platform and multi-client features are community-driven — implement based on demand.
